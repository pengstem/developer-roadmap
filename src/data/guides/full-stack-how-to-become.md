## A step-by-step guide on how to become a full stack developer

Learning full stack development can be a lot to handle. There is so much material—tutorials, blogs, videos—that it can be hard to find where to begin and what resources to rely on. Thankfully, you can make use of the step-by-step [full stack development](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) roadmap to learn and track your progress.

The full stack development guide provides clear explanations of all the necessary concepts. The steps below present a concise explanation of the full stack developer roadmap.

![A step-by-step guide on how to become a full stack developer](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/a-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-become-a-full-stack-developer-nd2r3.png)

**Step 1: Learn the basics of frontend development.**
[Learning frontend development](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) basics is important to becoming a successful full stack developer. Frontend development involves making a website look good, responsive, and user-friendly. It is the client side of web development, focusing on how web elements (forms, buttons, etc.) appear on a screen.

Frontend developers depend on three important languages to create interactive websites and applications:

- Hypertext markup languages **(HTML)**.
- Cascading style sheets **(CSS)**.
- JavaScript.

HTML and CSS go hand in hand when it comes to web development. HTML serves as the foundation for building web pages. It helps structure and organize the web elements of websites and applications. Examples of these web elements include images, headings, texts, links, and videos. CSS improves the visual appeal of the web elements. It allows you to control the user interface, add colors and spaces, and more using CSS selectors and IDs.

If you want to improve at HTML and CSS, use them to build projects. Do not only focus on studying; build and practice simultaneously. This approach will help you understand
HTML and CSS well. Some project ideas include:

- Create and design a resume that shows off your work experience.
- Create a responsive landing page for any product.
- Create a personal website or a blog.

[**JavaScript**](https://roadmap.sh/javascript) is a programming language used to make your website functional and interactive. It makes web elements like buttons, forms, and animations on your website work. To practice JavaScript, try building:

- A simple calculator.
- An interactive quiz application.
- A to-do list application.

Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is important to becoming a full stack developer. They work together to create static, interactive web pages that users engage with.

**Step 2: Learn frontend web development frameworks and libraries.**
Learning frameworks and libraries are the next step to becoming a full stack developer. Frontend web frameworks and libraries make it easier to create web interfaces.

[Frontend frameworks](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/frameworks) allow users to create websites and applications in a structured manner. They offer pre-written codes and templates to make the development process easier. This way, you won't have to start from scratch and can focus on making your application stand out. [Angular](https://roadmap.sh/angular), Tailwind CSS, Svelte, and [Vue.js](https://roadmap.sh/vue) are a few examples of popular frontend web frameworks.

In contrast, frontend libraries are pre-written codes that perform specific functionalities. They help expand on what frameworks can do, or you can use them alone for particular tasks. Some examples of these tasks include form validation, animation, and data visualization. Animate.css, Chart.js, and [React](https://roadmap.sh/react) are a few examples of popular frontend libraries.

Frameworks and libraries work together to make development easier in different ways. For example, the **Tailwind CSS** framework helps with responsive web design and layout. But if you want to spice things up with fancy animations, you can use a library like **Animate.css**. They work together to help you make web designs that are useful and look good at the same time.

Try building your own projects to understand how these frameworks and libraries work. It doesn't matter how simple these projects are; study and build projects. Some examples of projects to build include:

- Single-page applications **(SPAs)** like game applications.
- Responsive personal portfolio website.

These projects will help you understand and get better at different concepts. You must practice often and work on real projects to get good at using frameworks.

**Step 3: Understand version control systems**
The knowledge of version control systems **(VCS)** is important for full stack developers. VCS records every change made to your codebase, so you know who changed what, when, and why. Being able to do this is vital when working with experienced developers on the same project.

Some popular examples of VCS include Git **(GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket)**. [GitHub](https://roadmap.sh/git-github) lets you collaborate, store, and share your code using Git repositories. VCS has many advantages:

- It helps full stack developers collaborate without facing difficulties.
- It helps full stack developers try new ideas without fear of ruining the code.
- It saves a copy of your code so you can return to an earlier version if you have to.
- It provides access control and authentication. You can control who can edit, review, or manage your code. It keeps your code safe and tidy when working with other professional developers.

Knowing how to use VCS is important to become a full stack developer. It improves collaboration and helps organize difficult projects. This documentation contains everything you need to know about [**Git**](https://github.com/git-guides).

**Step 4: Learn backend web development**
Now that you know frontend concepts, it is time to [learn backend web development](https://roadmap.sh/backend). Backend development is the process of building the server side of web applications. It is where the behind-the-scenes operations that make the frontend interface work happen. This part of server-side development focuses on:

- Management of databases.
- Application programming interfaces **(APIs)** development.
- Server-side logic and more.

Backend developers create applications using different backend programming languages and frameworks like:

- [Node.js](https://roadmap.sh/nodejs)
- [Python](https://roadmap.sh/python)
- C#
- Ruby
- [Java](https://roadmap.sh/java)

These backend programming languages have specific strengths and weaknesses. Choosing a language comes down to what the project needs, what your team is good at, and what you like.

If you are looking to start backend development, I recommend learning Node.js. Node.js runs on JavaScript, which is the primary language for backend development. Since you already know JavaScript from the frontend, it will be easy to learn. Node.js allows you to build dynamic backend applications using JavaScript. So, you can work across the whole tech stack **(both the frontend and backend)** using one language.

Node.js has many cool packages and libraries; you can get them through the Node Package Manager **(NPM)**. These resources provide existing solutions like authentication with OAuth for everyday tasks. You can also use Node.js on any operating system, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.

It is important to practice as you learn to understand how it works better. Think about working on projects that combine your frontend abilities with backend features. Practice Node.js by building basic CRUD **(Create, Read, Update, Delete)** applications, like:

- Social media applications, e.g., Twitter.
- Project management applications, e.g., Jira.
- Online shopping websites, e.g., Amazon.

Building CRUD applications will teach you how to handle and work with databases. As you continue learning, build more complex applications that combine different functionalities. For example, you can create a project with user authentication to log in and sign up for an application.

The following are some of the most important concepts to focus on when learning Node.js:

- **Database interactions**: [MongoDB](https://roadmap.sh/mongodb), PostgreSQL, MySQL, CRUD operations.
- **File and module system**: Reading and writing files, local vs. global modules, NPM.
- **Asynchronous programming**: Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await syntax, event emitters, etc.
- **Event loop**: Task queues, event listeners, handling of I/O operations.
- **Express.js framework**: routing, middleware, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), RESTful APIs.
- **Authentication and security**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), OAuth implementation, Security best practices, etc.

After learning Node.js and its ecosystem, you can move on to [**Java**](https://roadmap.sh/java), [**Python**](https://roadmap.sh/python), C#, [**Go**](https://roadmap.sh/golang), Ruby or [**Rust**](https://roadmap.sh/rust)**.** Understanding the differences between these languages will help you choose the best tool.

**Note**: As you keep learning more tools, you will realize there is too much to learn, and you can never know everything. I advise you to get very good at using one tool **(such as Node.js)** and have a basic understanding of others. Keep improving using that one tool, and you will be good to go.

**Step 5: Learn DevOps and deployment basics**
To be a skilled full stack developer, you must know your way around DevOps and deployment. DevOps combines software development and IT operations to improve software delivery. It makes developing, managing, and deploying applications a whole lot easier.

The first step in [learning DevOps](https://roadmap.sh/devops) is to learn about Linux basics, cloud services, and CI/CD pipelines. These skills are important for deploying and managing software applications. The following are areas you should focus on when learning:

- **Linux basics**: Learn Linux, file systems, networking, and security.
- **Version control systems**: Learn to use [Git](https://roadmap.sh/git-github) to manage code and collaborate.
- **Cloud services**: Learn about [AWS](https://roadmap.sh/aws), Azure, or Google Cloud.
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Learn testing and deployment using tools like Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Learn tools like Terraform for infrastructure automation.

As soon as you have an understanding of these basics, it's time to put your new skills into practice. First, try deploying your full stack applications to cloud platforms like [AWS](https://roadmap.sh/aws) or Heroku. This will help you get real experience managing and maintaining live applications. You can start with easy applications and work up to harder ones.

Next, you will learn about automation and monitoring when working on your projects. GitHub Actions and Ansible are useful tools for this purpose. They assist in automating development, deployment, and configuration tasks. Knowing these DevOps concepts will help you handle the demands of full stack development.

**Step 6: Network and consistently learn more.**
Building your full stack developer skills requires consistent learning and networking. It involves spending time self-learning, building friendships, and growing skill sets. The tips below will help you learn and network better:

- Take online courses and watch online tutorials to understand full stack development concepts better.
- Read books and articles about web development, programming languages, and software engineering.
- Contribute to open-source projects to gain experience and develop relationships with full stack professionals.
- Join communities like the [roadmap community](https://discord.com/invite/cJpEt5Qbwa) to learn from other professional developers.
- Attend conferences, meetups, and online forums to learn from industry professionals.
- Take part in coding challenges and hackathons to practice and learn.

Consistent learning and networking will help you become a better full stack developer. It will help you succeed, keep up with the latest technologies, and solve coding problems.

**Step 7: Build a portfolio and apply for jobs**
As a developer, you work on projects to improve your skill set and get a full stack developer job. But to show off these projects to a hiring manager, you must have them all in one place. For this reason, it is important to have a portfolio if you want to become a full stack developer.

Portfolios are compilations of your best work that showcase your skills and experiences. It is like a resume, but instead of bullet points listing your coding skills, it shows you pictures and more work details. Among the many benefits of owning a portfolio are:

- It shows a hiring manager that you can do the job, not just talk about it.
- It shows your full stack developer skills across both old and new technologies.
- It sets you apart from other developers who have similar qualifications.

When creating your portfolio, include projects that show your skills with different tools. The following are some project ideas to add to your portfolio:

- **Personal projects**: Examples of these applications can be budgeting or recipe applications.
- **Open-source contributions**: Add links to your open-source contributions.
- **Full** **\*\***stack applications\*\*: Create applications that show off your frontend and backend development skills. An example of this application is an online shopping website with user authentication.
- **API development**: Build and include RESTFUL APIs in your portfolio. It will show off your skills in the back-end, working with Node.js and other programming languages.

After you have built a portfolio, it is time to start job hunting for full stack development jobs. This involves creating a resume and cover letter and prepping for interviews.

**Note:** To become a full stack developer, you must create the habit of always learning. So, if you get the job or not, it doesn't matter; you have to keep learning and improving your coding skills.

While a portfolio is not always required when applying for full stack development jobs, it's a good idea to start building one. However, when you first start applying for jobs, a GitHub profile with your key projects may be enough; you can use pinned repositories to display your best work. With time, you can create your full stack developer portfolio to display your projects.
