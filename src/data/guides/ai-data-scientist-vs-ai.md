![Data Science vs AI: What are the differences?](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/data-science-vs-artificial-intelligence-w7gl5.jpg)

Choosing between specializing in data science and AI comes down to what you like and the problems you want to solve. If you enjoy analyzing data, uncovering insights, and making data-driven decisions, data science might be for you. But artificial intelligence is the way to go if you're into creating systems that can learn, adapt, and make decisions on their own.

When I first got into tech, I wasn't sure which path to take. I spent late nights researching, feeling both excited and overwhelmed. Data science and AI seemed so similar that telling them apart felt impossible, especially since many jobs required skills in both. But as I dug deeper, I realized they have distinct focuses despite their overlap.

Data science focuses on extracting meaningful insights from data. As a data scientist, you'll be responsible for designing datasets, building models to analyze data, identifying patterns, and solving complex problems to help businesses make better decisions. You'll do this using statistical analysis and several machine learning techniques like supervised and unsupervised learning.

In contrast, artificial intelligence is about developing intelligent systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include pattern recognition, predictive analysis, and language translation. You'll design algorithms to learn and solve problems without constant human intervention.

If you don't know much about data science and AI, don't worry about it. Check out our beginner's guide on [data science](https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist) and [AI](https://roadmap.sh/ai-engineer) to get a good overview of both fields. In this guide, I'll show you what each field is about, the skills you need, and the opportunities they offer. By the end, you'll know which career path suits you best based on your interests, skills, and goals.

## Primary focus

One big difference between data science and AI is what they focus on the most. Data science focuses on uncovering insights and solving problems through data analytics. It uses structured data like customer databases to identify patterns and solve complex problems. You'll use advanced tools and machine learning techniques like computer vision to work with unstructured data like videos and images.

If you choose data science, you'll work on extracting valuable insights from data. For example, a data scientist working in finance will use anomaly detection to analyze transactional data. This helps with fraud detection and risk assessment, e.g., unusual login attempts.

In contrast, if you choose artificial intelligence, you'll focus on building systems that mimic human intelligence, like learning, reasoning, and solving problems. It uses structured and unstructured data to enable machines to perform tasks like pattern recognition in images and speech and natural language processing. For example, AI virtual assistants like Siri can listen and reply to what you're saying. They use natural language processing models to recognize and understand your voice (human language). It makes it easy for you to ask and get answers to questions just by talking.

## Daily responsibilities 

Data scientists and AI engineers have different responsibilities that show their focus areas. As a data scientist, your daily duties will include:

- **Data collection**: This is often the first thing you do when extracting insights from data. Your job will be to collect large volumes of data from several sources, such as databases. For example, a healthcare data scientist will collect and analyze patient data to create models to help in diagnosing diseases. It'll make it easier to predict patient outcomes and make treatment plans better.
- **Data cleaning**: After you collect all the data, the next step is to clean the data. Doing this means removing errors from the raw data to prepare it for data analysis.
- **Data analysis**: After cleaning, you'll analyze data to identify patterns and trends. You'll do this using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques like clustering.
- **Building models**: You'll create predictive models to make future predictions based on historical data. A company like Netflix, for example, uses predictive models to suggest TV shows and movies to you. The data scientist will analyze your past data to see what shows you've watched, how you rated them, and more. Then, they will use this data to build a model that suggests similar shows you'll like.
- **Data visualization**: Visualizing data is about presenting complex data in a visual format. As a data scientist, you'll use data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI to present data in a way that every team member will understand.

![Data science vs. artificial intelligence: Job responsibilities](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/responsibilities-of-a-data-scientist-and-ai-engineer-wzlzh.png)

On the flip side, AI involves various responsibilities like designing, training, and testing AI models. As an AI engineer, your daily responsibilities will include:

- **Data preparation**: You'll collect, clean, analyze, and work with large amounts of data to train and test AI models (i.e., machine learning models). Yes, as an AI engineer, you'll also analyze data, although it is the primary duty of the data scientists. Doing this lets you check if the data is good for the AI model and spot any problems that could mess up the training.
- **Model training**: You'll be responsible for developing algorithms that enable machines to learn from data using machine learning techniques like computer vision and neural networks. For example, automotive industries use artificial intelligence to create self-driving cars. They use AI algorithms to analyze sensor data from cameras, radar, and lasers to see what's around them.
- **Review models**: You'll test and make sure that the models provide reliable results. Imagine you've developed a model to identify diseases from analyzing medical images. You'll use images the model hasn't seen before to test its accuracy at spotting diseases. If it misses something, that's your cue to tweak it until it gets better.
- **Implementation**: Once you create a model, you need to make sure it works well with other systems. It's like having a chatbot on a website to handle customer inquiries, using a fraud detection system in a bank to analyze transactions, or incorporating GPS functionality in self-driving cars for navigation. Additionally, you'll monitor and maintain its performance and update it when needed.

## The tools you'll use
