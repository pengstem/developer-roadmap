![Java vs JavaScript](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/java-vs-javascript-66pqp.jpg)

Java and JavaScript are among the most popular programming languages in web development. They were both created in 1995: Sun Microsystems released Java in May, and Netscape released JavaScript in September. Despite coming out in the same year with similar names, Java and Javascript are two distinct programming languages with different designs, purposes, and use cases.

[Java](https://roadmap.sh/java) is an object-oriented programming language used to create complex web applications ranging from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise software like banking software. Java is platform-independent—it can work on any device with a Java Virtual Machine **(JVM)** installed. This makes it suitable for backend development and high-performance software.

In contrast, [JavaScript](https://roadmap.sh/javascript) is a lightweight scripting language for creating dynamic web interactions. It runs in web browsers and enables developers to build interactive web pages. Examples of these interactions include forms, animations, and more. JavaScript is often used alongside HTML and CSS in frontend web development. However, full stack developers now use JavaScript through Node.js to create backend applications.

Knowing when to use each language will help you choose the right one for your projects and career goals. I will explain the key differences between Java and JavaScript in this guide. I will also cover their syntax, runtime environments, key features, advantages, and disadvantages.

**TL;DR:**
Java and JavaScript may share similar names, but they serve distinct purposes. Thanks to its platform independence and high performance, Java is a robust, object-oriented language ideal for building large-scale applications like enterprise software and Android apps. Conversely, JavaScript is a lightweight, flexible scripting language used for creating dynamic, interactive web pages and full stack applications with tools like Node.js. Each language excels in different use cases—choose Java for backend-heavy, scalable systems and JavaScript for web interactivity and rapid development.

## The key differences between Java and JavaScript

Note that the purpose of this guide is not to compare or select a winner between Java and JavaScript. Instead, it aims to help you know the strengths of each programming language and which to use.

The table below summarizes the differences between both programming languages:

| Characteristic        | Java                                              | JavaScript                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Syntax                | Statically typed, verbose                         | Dynamically typed, concise                                    |
| Runtime environment   | JVM                                               | Web Browser                                                   |
| Execution environment | Server-side programming                           | Client-side, server-side (Node.js)                            |
| Primary use case      | Server-side application development, Android apps | Client-side development                                       |
| Performance           | High-performance, optimized                       | Often slower, more flexible                                   |
| Compilation           | Compiled into bytecode (compiled language)        | Interpreted in web browsers or Node.js (interpreted language) |

### Java vs. JavaScript: Syntax

Java and JavaScript have different syntaxes. Java is a statically typed language with a more verbose syntax. It has a more rigid syntax, so developers must declare exactly the variable type they use. Doing this leads to fewer errors but requires more lines of code to complete a task. The following are syntax code snippets showing this:

```java
int number = 5;
String message = "Sign up on roadmap";
```

In contrast, JavaScript is a dynamically typed language with a more concise syntax. It is more flexible, so you do not have to declare what type of variable you are using. Doing this makes coding faster but leads to runtime errors if you are not careful. Example of a JavaScript code syntax:

```javascript
let number = 5;
number = 'Sign up on roadmap'; // The number variable can be casually reassigned to a string
```

Usually saved in a .js file extension, this code will show **"Sign up on roadmap"** on the console.

### Java vs. JavaScript: Execution and runtime

Java is often used for server-side programming. It is a compiled language that requires a Java Virtual Machine **(JVM)** to run Java code. Before running your code, it's compiled into bytecode, a platform-independent format. The JVM then executes the bytecode to ensure that Java programs run on any system with JVM installed. It makes Java a good choice for large-scale applications that run on any operating system. These operating systems include Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices.

JavaScript, however, is often used for client-side web development. It is an interpreted language that runs in the web browser **(Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.)** or runtime environment like Node.js. There is no separate compilation step like in Java programming language. Instead, developers can see the results of their code changes as soon as they make them. Doing this makes JavaScript a good choice for building interactive websites.

### Java vs. JavaScript: Use case suitability

Java is an [object-oriented programming language](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP) used to build various applications. It's quick, dependable, and versatile, so it's great for creating:

- Native apps.
- Data analysis tools.
- Desktop apps.
- Backend apps.
- Android apps.

![](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/java-vs-javascript-use-case-suitability-ev9gw.png)

JavaScript is a scripting language used to create a web application user interface. Its dynamic nature makes it work well with web browsers, which is good for:

- Game development.
- Interactive web page experiences.
- Cross-platform app development (with React Native framework).
- Frontend and full stack development (Node.js).

Java and JavaScript are important for a lot of leading tech companies**.** Tech companies like \*\*\*\*Amazon, Netflix, and Uber use Java for their backend systems, while Google, Facebook, and Netflix use JavaScript for their frontend services.

### Performance impacts

Java's compiled nature makes it better for building large-scale applications. However, its setup and execution can take a bit more time. So, it's not as perfect as JavaScript for tasks that need quick feedback, like chat apps.

JavaScript focuses on being fast and flexible for client-side interactions. Its event-driven nature makes carrying out tasks like document object model (DOM) manipulation easy. But, it may struggle with CPU-intensive tasks like data compression and decompression.

## Key features of JavaScript and Java

Java and JavaScript each have unique features that are perfect for specific tasks. The table below summarizes the key features of both programming languages:

| Features          | Java                         | JavaScript                                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Concurrency       | Multi-threading support      | Event-driven, single-threaded with asynchronous built-in support |
| Inheritance model | Class-based inheritance      | Prototype-based inheritance                                      |
| Memory management | Automatic garbage collection | Automatic garbage collection (modern engines)                    |
| Cross-platform    | JVM                          | Browsers and on servers (Node.js)                                |
| Paradigm          | Primarily object-oriented    | Multi-paradigm                                                   |

### Multi-threading vs. Asynchronous calls

Java is an object-based programming language with built-in support for multi-threading. It lets you write applications that run multiple threads **(many tasks)** at the same time. Multi-threading is especially useful for server-side applications, such as web application servers. It lets them juggle many requests at once, making them run quicker and more responsive.

JavaScript, unlike Java, is single-threaded. So, it can only work on one task at a time. However, It has built-in support for asynchronous programming **(callbacks, promises, and async/await)**. This way, developers can work on many background tasks without blocking the main task. It helps create responsive and non-blocking web applications, e.g., chat applications.

The event-driven nature of the JavaScript language is another key feature. It enables websites to react to user actions, e.g., button clicks, so it's great for building the frontend of websites. However, Java's object-oriented nature makes it great for creating robust backends of websites.

### Memory management

Java uses automatic garbage collection \*\*\*\*for memory management. So, developers don't have to worry about managing memory for their apps by themselves. The Java garbage collector cleans up and gets rid of unused memory often. It prevents memory leaks by removing the need for manual memory management. Due to this, Java is a good choice for backend systems that need to be scalable and stable.

![](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/memory-management-tdg2z.png)

Developers had to handle memory management themselves in earlier versions of JavaScript. However, [modern JavaScript engines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_management) like V8 now have good garbage collection systems. These updates improve memory management and make apps and websites run faster. It also enables developers to focus on how to write code rather than on memory issues.

### Cross-platform support

Although both Java and JavaScript support different platforms, they provide good cross-platform compatibility. Java is a platform-independent language because it runs on the Java platform. Any device with an installed Java Virtual Machine can run the Java code you write. It is great for developers because they can write their code once and use it anywhere.

![](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/cross-platform-support-ck38q.png)

In contrast, JavaScript operates in web browsers. It is easy to use on all devices and platforms without extra setup. Any device can run your JavaScript code as long as it has a web browser. Also, with tools like Node.js, you can now use JavaScript for server-side development. It makes it easy for a full stack developer to work with JavaScript on frontend and backend projects. Thanks to Node.js, JavaScript can run on many platforms past the browser, e.g., Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

## Advantages and disadvantages of Java and JavaScript

When choosing between both languages, weigh their strengths and weaknesses. You can determine what is best for your project by being aware of these factors.

- **Complex learning curve:** Java is a complex language, especially for beginners. Its many programming concepts, syntax, etc., make it hard to learn Java.

### Advantages of JavaScript

- **Easy learning curve**: It is easier to learn JavaScript because of its flexible syntax. Unlike Java, your code will still work if you forget specific rules like semicolons. So, it's the first programming language for most newbies going into web development.
- **Flexibility**: JavaScript is a versatile programming language. It works for both frontend and backend development **(with Node.js)**. You can build a whole web application from start to finish using JavaScript.
- **Large Ecosystem**: One major advantage of JavaScript is its ecosystem. It has a large and active ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, e.g., React and Vue. Unlike other languages, JavaScript's ecosystem is always growing with new tools and resources. This makes learning JavaScript and building web apps way easier for developers.
- **Less overhead**: JavaScript has less overhead compared to other languages. It is a lightweight programming language that needs fewer system resources to run. It helps speed up web apps, so pages load and respond fast to user actions **(e.g., button clicks)**.

### Disadvantages of JavaScript

- **Security risks:** Poorly written or insecure JavaScript code can cause client-side security risks. Since JavaScript code runs on the user's browser, anyone visiting your website can see it. Hackers can abuse it, causing security problems like [Cross-Site Scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) (XSS).
- **Browser inconsistencies:** JavaScript can have browser inconsistencies. Web browsers like Google Chrome might interpret JavaScript code in different ways. It could cause issues where your website or web app works fine in one browser but not in another. This results in difficulty building sites that work the same on all browsers.

## Factors to consider when choosing between JavaScript and Java

Deciding between Java or JavaScript comes down to a few factors. It is not about one language being better; it's just about picking the one that works best for you. Let's take a closer look at these factors:
