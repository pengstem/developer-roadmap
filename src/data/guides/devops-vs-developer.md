## How do a DevOps engineer and a software developer differ?

A [DevOps engineer](https://roadmap.sh/devops/devops-engineer) focuses on automating infrastructure, managing deployments, and ensuring smooth integration between development and operations, while a software developer primarily writes code to build applications or features.

![DevOps Engineer vs Software Developer](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/devops-engineer-vs-software-developer-qodix.png)

A software developer creates quality code and builds software applications. They focus primarily on designing, development, application testing, and software maintenance.

Some may specialize in frontend, backend, or even full stack development, giving them the flexibility to manage comprehensive software projects.

For HR professionals, if your organization wants to improve operational efficiency and teamwork across departments, hiring a DevOps engineer could be a good choice. On the other hand, if your focus is on innovation and coding, a skilled software developer or full stack developer might be the better option.

A skilled software developer knows the right tools and programming languages essential to build applications. Some experts even have [frontend](https://roadmap.sh/frontend), [backend](https://roadmap.sh/backend), or [full stack](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) development experience.

However, DevOps is a broader field that involves collaboration between the development and IT operations teams. Software developers majorly focus on writing codes, whereas DevOps ensures that the generated code works well.

Some of the key tasks of a software developer include:

- **Coding and development:** using different programming languages and frameworks to create clean code for your software.
- **Testing:** running tests to get more clarity on whether the implemented code functions correctly and guarantees smooth software performance.
- **Deployment**: While traditionally managed by the DevOps team, many developers now handle deployment processes, especially in smaller teams.

On the other hand, DevOps engineer's key tasks include:

- **Automation DevOps**: automating all the tasks from testing software to deploying CI/CD pipelines.
- **Infrastructure management**: facilitating collaboration and managing the entire infrastructure to ensure smooth application performance.
- **Monitoring and maintenance**: using monitoring tools to track issues and application performance in real time.

## Importance of collaboration with cross-functional teams in both roles

Both developers and DevOps engineers need to collaborate with cross-functional teams for a smooth workflow.

Working with cross-functional teams is essential for both software developers and DevOps engineers. These interactions streamline workflows, improve communication, and ensure that each department's needs and constraints are understood throughout the project lifecycle.

**Hiring resource tip:** DevOps engineers may be more suitable for roles requiring collaboration across departments, whereas software developers, including full-stack developers, are better suited to focused development tasks.

**Career insight -** As a software developer, your interaction might be limited to the design, development, and testing phases. However, moving toward DevOps expands your scope to include operational aspects, which could be beneficial for long-term career growth.

Software developers need to constantly communicate with other developers on the team, designers, and even quality assurance(QA) engineers to ensure the delivery of high-quality software. Their collaboration is primarily focused on software functionalities. In the early stages of the traditional software development process, developers were not very involved in how their code operated in production. A separate department, i.e., the IT operations team or deployment manager, was responsible for tracking application deployment.

![Collaboration and team dynamics](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/collaboration-and-team-dynamics-k302s.png)

In the case of DevOps, things are completely different. Their collaboration with cross-functional teams goes beyond the development process. The DevOps concept was introduced to bridge the gap between development and operations for smooth workflow and rapid delivery. The development and IT operation team need to frequently communicate and provide quick feedback on different aspects for efficient software performance and deployment of code changes.

The incorporation of DevOps practices will enable organizations to improve their product quality, automate complex and repetitive tasks, detect errors in real time, and deploy new features in less time.

Let’s understand more about software developers and DevOps engineers' responsibilities and processes.
