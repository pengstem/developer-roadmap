## What are data science and data analytics?

Data science and data analytics are two multidisciplinary fields that share the goal of helping organizations make smarter decisions, but they achieve this in different ways.

Data science uses advanced tools like machine learning and AI to extract insights from large, complex data sets. As a data scientist, your role is to uncover patterns and build predictive models that solve problems like fraud detection, ad optimization, and trend forecasting. Tools like [Python](https://roadmap.sh/python), Apache Spark, and [SQL](https://roadmap.sh/sql) are key to this work.

Data analytics, meanwhile, focuses on interpreting existing data to uncover trends and deliver actionable insights. As a data analyst, you'll use data analytics tools like Excel, Tableau, and Power BI to identify patterns, forecast sales, analyze customer behavior, and guide strategy. This work is grounded in understanding what has already happened to influence future business decisions.

By understanding the distinct purposes of these roles, we can examine how they interact to drive meaningful results.

## How do data science and data analytics complement each other?

For example, consider an ecommerce business whose sales have declined over the past quarter. A data analyst would start by examining historical sales data using tools like Excel or SQL to identify patterns and uncover potential causes, such as price changes or shifting customer demographics. These findings would then inform the data science team.

The data scientists would take this further by building predictive models to analyze future sales trends. They might incorporate additional features, like customer feedback or competitor pricing, to provide proactive recommendations that could reverse the decline, such as adjusting pricing strategies or launching targeted campaigns.

Therefore, data analytics helps you answer the "**what**,** why**, and **where**" questions. For example, you can use it to ask, "what caused past sales?" or "why did customer churn go up in Q1?" or "where is our main revenue coming from?" By looking at historical data, data analytics gives you the answers you need to improve and build better strategies.

The data science process takes it a step further by answering the "**why**" and **"how**" questions, like why sales went down and how to fix it. Data science leverages machine learning algorithms and predictive techniques to provide you with the right solutions to move forward.

Next, explore the specific job roles and responsibilities in data science and data analytics.

## **Data science vs. data analytics:** **Job role and responsibilities**

Here are the primary responsibilities that define the role of a data analyst and how they contribute to enabling data-informed business decisions.

- **Design algorithms:** Develop new algorithms to optimize business operations, such as fraud detection systems or creating personalized recommendations for customers.
- **Data experimentation:** Identify hidden patterns and extract meaningful insights from large and unstructured data sets.

**Key responsibilities of data analyst**
As a data analyst, you focus on understanding structured data to answer specific business queries and make smart decisions. For example, to identify sales trends over the past year, you will perform the following tasks:

- **Data collection and processing:** Gather information from different sources and remove inaccuracies or unnecessary data. Use data-cleaning method to maintain accuracy and prepare data for analysis.
- **Data analysis:** Interpret formatted and cleaned data using statistical tools and advanced modeling techniques.
- **Data reporting:** Create clear and concise reports to share with business.
- **Business recommendations:** Provide recommendations based on what you found to improve sales, efficiency, and performance.
