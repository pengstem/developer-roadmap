![DevOps vs DevSecOps comparison guide](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/devops-vs-devsecops-3drth.jpg)

Over the years, the demand for high-quality software and resilient systems has grown significantly. Businesses are under immense pressure to deliver software faster than ever. However, rushing development often comes with trade-offs, such as increased security risks that can compromise entire systems.

Traditional development practices struggled to keep up with the need for both speed and security, creating a critical challenge for organizations. To address the challenge of balancing rapid software delivery with the need for robust security and quality, two models were introduced: DevOps and DevSecOps.

[DevOps](https://roadmap.sh/devops/devops-engineer) focuses on streamlining the development and operations lifecycle to deliver software quickly. DevSecOps integrates security practices into the DevOps pipeline, prioritizing security from the start and throughout the entire development process.

In this blog, you will learn about the main purpose and role of DevOps and DevSecOps. You will also explore a comparison between the two, helping you determine which approach is right for your needs. Understanding the key differences and benefits is essential to choosing the right model, so keep reading!

Below is a quick comparison table of DevOps vs. DevSecOps for easier reference:

## DevOps vs DevSecOps: How are they different?

Choosing between DevOps and DevSecOps can determine whether your software is fast—or secure from the start.

While both approaches aim to enhance collaboration and efficiency in software development, DevSecOps incorporates security practices early in the development cycle, unlike DevOps, which often addresses security issues at a later stage.

DevOps is primarily focused on improving collaboration between design, development, and operations teams to speed up software delivery. The core idea is to remove bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the development pipeline. DevOps engineers are skilled in coding, automation, and system administration, and they focus on delivering high-quality software with minimal errors, often through continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

![Understanding DevOps vs DevSecOps](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/understanding-devops-vs-devsecops-v9tkn.png)

On the other hand, DevSecOps brings security into the equation by integrating cybersecurity practices throughout the development process. This approach arose to address increasing cyber threats by embedding security checks at every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). While DevOps ensures quick software delivery, DevSecOps emphasizes secure and compliant software delivery by shifting security considerations to the left of the development timeline, ensuring that vulnerabilities are detected early.

## Security in DevOps vs. DevSecOps: A Closer Look at Processes and Tools

One of the key differences between DevOps and DevSecOps lies in how they handle security.
In DevOps workflows, security testing typically occurs near the end of the development cycle, during quality assurance or post-deployment. Security measures, such as patches or vulnerability scanning, are often applied as part of the release process. This can result in delayed launches or costly remediation efforts if critical issues are discovered late in the pipeline.

![Role of security in DevOps and DevSecOps](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/role-of-security-rj7j1.png)

DevSecOps, on the other hand, focuses on strengthening deployment security and maintaining data protection and compliance by tracking issues as they arise. This approach uses both shift-left and shift-right security testing strategies. Shift-left testing involves identifying security vulnerabilities early in the development process, even before code is merged. 

Tools like static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and dependency checkers are embedded into CI/CD pipelines to catch publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. Additionally, automated scanners and code analyzers ensure that potential risks are flagged before reaching production.

For example, in a DevOps environment, a team may identify security vulnerabilities only after a routine code audit or during the final phase of testing. However, in a DevSecOps setup, automated security checks would be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, flagging issues in real time before code is deployed, saving time and mitigating risks.

### Shift-Left and Shift-Right Strategies

[Shift-left security](https://roadmap.sh/devops/shift-left-testing) is a key component of DevSecOps. With early security testing (shift-left security), DevSecOps helps identify risks and prevent product compromise. Addressing errors during the production phase is far more cost-effective than fixing them after deployment. Additionally, continuous security testing reinforces compliance with industry standards.

A real-world example of the consequences of delayed security integration is the [2017 Equifax data breach](https://archive.epic.org/privacy/data-breach/equifax/). A known vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework was left unpatched, resulting in the exposure of sensitive customer data for over 147 million people. Had shift-left security practices been in place, experts could have flagged the outdated library during the early stages of development and prevented breach.

Shift-right testing is equally important as it helps developers detect security threats and fix issues in real time. Delays in security threat detection can impact product integrity and customer trust.

For instance, imagine your organization is working on financial application design and creation, in which security processes and tests are supposed to run during the final phase. 

In such a case, issue detection at the final phase can result in a product launch delay. This might also result in higher costs. And if, to avoid a launch delay, you introduce the product, the unresolved vulnerabilities can hamper your reputation and erode customer trust.

DevSecOps understands the impact of security issues and thus recommend implementing shift-left and shift-right strategies that help reduce vulnerabilities and achieve faster time to market, thus saving your organizational reputation and customer trust.

## How DevOps and DevSecOps affect business goals?

DevOps and DevSecOps affects several key business such as time to market, customer satisfaction, operational efficiency and risk management. Here's how they affect these goals.

1. **Time to market**

DevOps speeds up product delivery by automating workflows, removing bottlenecks and enabling faster iterations. DevSecOps puts the necessary checks in place without derailing development timelines so businesses can maintain a regular release cadence and meet market demand.

2. **Customer satisfaction**

DevOps delivers frequent updates and new features to keep up with customer demand and improve user experience. DevSecOps builds on this by delivering secure and reliable products, reducing the risk of issues that will frustrate users. Both speed and reliability increases customer trust and loyalty.

3. **Operational efficiency**

DevOps makes tasks more efficient by removing duplication, eliminating manual intervention. DevSecOps adds to this by addressing risks early, avoiding rework or operational downtime. Together they reduce development costs and increase productivity.

4. **Risk management**

DevOps allows for faster iterations and deployments which can introduce risks if not managed properly. DevSecOps mitigates these risks by making security a core part of the development lifecycle. This proactive approach reduces the chance of breaches or compliance issues and protects the business's reputation and financials.

## Core processes in DevOps and DevSecOps

To accelerate the software development lifecycle, DevOps gives more attention to automation and collaboration. Monitoring in DevOps primarily focuses on performance, availability, and system uptime. Metrics like CPU utilization, application response times, and log aggregation form the foundation of DevOps monitoring strategies. Incident response, while essential, is reactive in nature—triggered only after an issue, such as a system crash or performance degradation, arises.

DevSecOps runs security tests in all stages, thus adopting a more proactive approach. Continuous monitoring in DevSecOps goes beyond traditional metrics to include threat detection, vulnerability scanning, and compliance checks, focusing more on reducing risk and cost. They even use tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems and cloud-native security platforms to detect threats in real time. Incident response in DevSecOps involves automated playbooks and AI-driven analysis to address vulnerabilities, often before they can escalate rapidly. 

In fact, DevSecOps even employs SAST and DAST strategies that help identify security vulnerabilities faster. Under SAST, professionals scans source code early to prevent vulnerabilities from entering production. Some of the common SAST tools are [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/) and [Checkmarx](https://checkmarx.com/).

However, under the DAST strategy, professionals evaluate applications in their running state to identify vulnerabilities. Some of the common DAST tools are [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) and [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) which help identify injection flaws and security misconfigurations.

Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST), another practice that combines SAST and DAST, operates within the application runtime environment to provide detailed insights into vulnerabilities during testing and QA phases.

These advanced testing methodologies—SAST, DAST, and IAST—not only enhance security within specific stages of development but also lay the groundwork for broader, innovative practices in continuous security monitoring. These emerging practices are redefining traditional monitoring and response strategies:

### Real-time incident response

DevSecOps uses tools that use AI and machine learning for real-time threat detection and mitigation.

Examples of tools used for real-time response in DevSecOps are Splunk, Datadog Security Monitoring, and CrowdStrike Falcon which do AI driven threat detection and automated response to incidents.

### Behavioral analytics

Monitoring user and application behavior allows DevSecOps teams to detect anomalies such as data access or traffic patterns that are not normal which could be a breach.

### Continuous compliance

DevSecOps embeds security policies and regulatory standards into the development process for continuous compliance. Teams use automation tools like Policy-as-Code frameworks and compliance scanners to enforce and validate against standards like GDPR, HIPAA and PCI DSS. This way reduces compliance risks and makes auditing easier.

## Moving from DevOps to DevSecOps

The shift from DevOps to DevSecOps is a critical evolution for organizations aiming to integrate security seamlessly into the development lifecycle. Below is a guide to facilitate this transition, highlighting actionable steps, tools, and strategies for success.

![Moving from DevOps to DevSecOps](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/moving-from-devops-to-devsecops-gimtv.png)

### Understand your goals

Before implementing changes or transitioning to DevSecOps, step back and clearly lay out your goals. What do you want to achieve after transitioning to the DevSecOps model? Are you looking to enhance your security model or need faster software deployment? Being specific with your goals will help you make informed decisions and develop a plan that aligns with your goals.

### Current flow assessment

Before transitioning to a new model, it is important to assess and change the existing workflow. Trace areas that demand or require improvement and attention. For example, check for proper coordination and communication among development, operations, and security teams. Are there any loopholes or faults in your current workflow? Is security feedback consistently integrated into development cycles? Identify gaps in communication by hosting cross-team retrospectives or root cause analyses to get more clarity of your situation.

### Choose the right automation tool

If workflow efficiency is an issue, the best solution is to implement automation tools. These common tools can reduce manual tasks, run faster code reviews, perform security tests, and provide quick deployment. These tools further enable professionals to focus on other key areas and tasks, such as fixing errors or initiating new features within the application.

### Training your teammates

Adopting a new model or practice demands educating the team members early about the new process and security concerns. Inform and educate your team members about the importance of security systems and how integrating them can improve their overall performance. You can also run training sessions or seminars to cover more about security guidelines and standards. Help them understand rising security concerns, how to fill gaps, and how to integrate security throughout the software development cycle. This step will further prevent confusion and problems from escalating in the future.

Educating the team early prevents missteps and promotes ownership of the new processes. But. despite preparation, organizations often face challenges when transitioning to DevSecOps. Let us have a look at some common DevSecOps transition challenges.

## DevSecOps transition challenges

Remember, transitioning to DevSecOps is not as easy as it sounds. There are various challenges, but these can be managed with the right approach.

![DevSecOps Best Practices](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/devsecops-best-practices-m6e21.png)

Here are a few things to avoid in the transition period:

### Wrong tool selection

There is a wide range of security applications on the market, but make sure to select the right one that is relevant to your code and meets your requirements. Otherwise, you might find it hard to run in the long term.

For guidance on selecting the right tools, refer to the **"Top tools and processes for a smooth transition"** section, where we highlight specific tools and best practices to facilitate a successful DevSecOps implementation.

### Non-inclusion of operations and security teams

Security tests are conducted at every phase of software production. Excluding your operations and security teams from the monitoring and tracking process limits the ability to identify and address faults and bugs effectively. Involving security experts from the start allows them to provide guidance on misconfigurations, tools, and best practices.

### Speed over quality

DevOps emphasizes quick software delivery, which can sometimes lead to insufficient attention to quality and security functionality. This may affect the user experience and your business reputation. Allocating more time and effort to ensuring quality and integrating security practices can help strike the right balance.

### Code monitoring issues

Since code constantly changes in software production, keeping an eye on it at all times can be challenging for some professionals. It is important to introduce new configurations, tools, and practices that can identify vulnerabilities in real time.

## Top tools and processes for a smooth transition

Further, let's have a look at how tools and processes can facilitate this transition while keeping agility and innovation intact:

### Prioritize security-first CI/CD configurations

CI/CD pipelines are the backbone of modern DevOps workflows. Embedding security into these pipelines guarantees vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated at every stage. So, incorporate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools. 

Further, you can use HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to manage sensitive information securely. Also, you can set policies to prevent critical vulnerabilities using tools such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD.

### Embrace infrastructure as code (IaC)

IaC automates infrastructure provisioning, but it can also introduce risks if not properly secured. For a smooth transition, it is important to integrate security into IaC processes. You can invest in Terrascan to detect vulnerabilities in Terraform or implement [immutable infrastructure practices](https://devops.com/immutable-infrastructure-the-next-step-for-devops/) to reduce configuration drift. Further, you can conduct regular audits of IaC templates for misconfigurations.

### Leverage advanced threat modeling

Threat modeling makes certain that potential security risks are identified early. New tools and frameworks make this process more effective. Invest in AI-powered tools that automatically suggest mitigations for identified risks.

## Will DevSecOps replace DevOps?

No, DevSecOps will not replace DevOps; instead, it enhances it. Rather than being a replacement, DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps, bringing security practices into the development and operations workflow. While DevOps focuses on speed, collaboration, and efficiency, DevSecOps makes sure that security becomes an inherent part of these processes. For example, integrating security tools like Snyk or SonarQube into CI/CD pipelines helps organizations identify vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.

The two are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. DevSecOps acts as a bridge, ensuring that security doesn't become a bottleneck while maintaining the agility of DevOps. This natural evolution addresses the growing need for secure software development without compromising agility. Let's further learn how DevSecOps will evolve in the future.

## Future of DevSecOps

As cybersecurity threats grow in sophistication and compliance regulations tighten, DevSecOps is poised to become the cornerstone of secure software development. In the recent [CrowdStrike Global Threat Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/global-threat-report/), experts clearly stated that attacks hardly take a few minutes to succeed. The report also noted that CrowdStrike tracked over 230 adversaries leveraging the global adoption of cloud technologies for their attacks.

Tackling these challenges demands strategic teamwork and technical expertise. Here's how DevSecOps is expected to evolve and why it is the future of secure DevOps:

### Proactive threat mitigation

DevSecOps is transitioning from reactive to proactive security. Predictive threat analysis, enabled by AI and machine learning, will play a crucial role in identifying security concerns and vulnerabilities before exploitation. For example, tools like CrowdStrike will become essential for analyzing attack patterns.

### Integration with governance and compliance

Stricter regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA are driving a compliance-first culture. DevSecOps will increasingly integrate automated compliance checks into CI/CD pipelines, facilitating adherence to global standards without manual intervention.

### Rise of zero-trust architectures

The adoption of zero-trust principles will reshape security frameworks. DevSecOps will integrate zero-trust policies into development environments, guaranteeing continuous authentication and access verification. This approach will strengthen security for microservices and API-driven architectures.

### Cloud-native and container security

With the surge in cloud-native applications, securing containers and serverless environments will be a top priority. Several tools are available that will enable seamless security integration into cloud workloads, addressing misconfigurations and runtime vulnerabilities.

In fact, in terms of demand and salary, DevSecOps roles tend to offer higher salaries due to the specialized skill set and smaller talent pool. Soon, there will be more role demands for security teams, DevSecOps engineers, security automation specialists, and compliance analysts job profiles to integrate security systems throughout the SDLC.

## Conclusion

Now that you understand the differences between DevOps and DevSecOps, the choice comes down to your organization's specific goals and priorities.

If speed and efficiency are your primary focus, DevOps is a great fit. However, if security is paramount, DevSecOps is the better choice. By embedding security into every stage of the development lifecycle, DevSecOps helps mitigate vulnerabilities while ensuring compliance and quality.

Both methodologies hold significant value, but in an era of increasing cybersecurity threats, DevSecOps is becoming essential for organizations that prioritize secure innovation.
