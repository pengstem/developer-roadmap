![Data science lifecycle 101](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/data-science-lifecycle-eib3s.jpg)

Developing a data science project, from beginning to production is not a trivial task. It involves so many steps and so many complex tasks, that without some guardrails, releasing to production becomes ten times harder.

Here’s where the data science lifecycle comes into play. It brings a structured approach so that [data scientists](https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist), data analysts, and others can move forward together from raw data to actionable insights.

In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know about the data science lifecycle, its many variants, and how to pick the right one for your project.

So let’s get going\!

## Core Concepts of a Lifecycle

![Core concepts of a data science lifecycle](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/core-concepts-bn8g0.png)

To fully understand the concept of the lifecycle, we have to look at the core concepts inside this framework, and how they contribute to the delivery of a successful data science project.

### Problem Definition

Every data science project begins with a clear definition of the problem to be solved. This involves collaborating with key stakeholders to identify objectives and desired outcomes. Data scientists must understand the context and scope of the project to ensure that the goals align with business or research needs.

### Data Collection

In the data collection phase, data scientists and data engineers work together and gather relevant data from diverse data sources. This includes both structured and unstructured data, such as historical records, new data, or data streams. 

The process ensures the integration of all pertinent data, creating a robust dataset for the following stages. Data acquisition tools and strategies play a critical role in this phase.

### Data Preparation

This stage addresses the quality of raw data by cleaning and organizing it for analysis. Tasks such as treating inaccurate data, handling missing values, and converting raw data into usable formats are central to this stage. This stage prepares the data for further and more detailed analysis. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory data analysis stage is where the “data processing” happens. This stage focuses on uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Through data visualization techniques such as bar graphs and statistical models, data scientists perform a thorough data analysis and gain insights into the data’s structure and characteristics. 

Like every stage so far, this one lays the foundation for the upcoming stages. In this particular case, after performing a detailed EDA, data scientists have a much better understanding of the data they have to work with, and a pretty good idea of what they can do with it now.

### Model Building and Evaluation

The model building phase involves developing predictive or machine learning models tailored to the defined problem. Data scientists experiment with various machine learning algorithms and statistical models to determine the best approach. Here’s where data modeling happens, bridging the insights gained during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase with actionable predictions and outcomes used in the deployment phase.

Model evaluation follows, where the performance and accuracy of these models are tested to ensure reliability.

### Deployment and Monitoring

The final stage of this generic data science lifecycle involves deploying the model into a production environment. Here, data scientists, machine learning engineers, and quality assurance teams ensure that the model operates effectively within existing software systems. 

After this stage, continuous monitoring and maintenance are essential to address new data or changing conditions, which can impact the performance and accuracy of the model.

## Exploring 6 Popular Lifecycle Variants

![6 popular data science lifecycles](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/alternative-lifecycles-wdvp1.png)

The data science lifecycle offers various frameworks tailored to specific needs and contexts. Below, we explore six prominent variants:

### CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)

CRISP-DM is one of the most widely used frameworks in data science projects, especially within business contexts. 

It organizes the lifecycle into six stages: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. 

This iterative approach allows teams to revisit and refine previous steps as new insights emerge. CRISP-DM is ideal for projects where aligning technical efforts with business goals is very important.

**Example use case**: A retail company wants to improve customer segmentation for targeted marketing campaigns. Using CRISP-DM, the team starts with business understanding to define segmentation goals, gathers transaction and demographic data, prepares and cleans it, builds clustering models, evaluates their performance, and deploys the best model to group customers for personalized offers.

### KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases)

The KDD process focuses on extracting useful knowledge from large datasets. Its stages include Selection, Preprocessing, Transformation, Data Mining, and Interpretation/Evaluation. 

KDD emphasizes the academic and research-oriented aspects of data science, making it an ideal choice for experimental or exploratory projects in scientific domains. It offers a systematic approach to discovering patterns and insights in complex datasets.

**Example use case:** A research institute analyzes satellite data to study climate patterns. They follow KDD by selecting relevant datasets, preprocessing to remove noise, transforming data to highlight seasonal trends, applying data mining techniques to identify long-term climate changes, and interpreting results to publish findings.

### Data Analytics Lifecycle

This specific data science lifecycle is tailored for enterprise-level projects that prioritize actionable insights. It’s composed of six stages: Discovery, Data Preparation, Model Planning, Model Building, Communicating Results, and Operationalizing. 

The framework’s strengths lie in its alignment with business objectives and readiness for model deployment, making it ideal for organizations seeking to integrate data-driven solutions into their operations.

**Example use case:** A financial institution uses the Data Analytics Lifecycle to detect fraudulent transactions. They discover patterns in historical transaction data, prepare it by cleaning and normalizing, plan predictive models, build and test them, communicate results to fraud prevention teams, and operationalize the model to monitor real-time transactions.

### SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess)

SEMMA is a straightforward and tool-centric framework developed by SAS. It focuses on sampling data, exploring it for patterns, modifying it for analysis, modeling it for predictions, and assessing the outcomes. 

This lifecycle is particularly useful for workflows involving specific analytics tools. Its simplicity and strong emphasis on data exploration make it an excellent choice for teams prioritizing rapid insights.

**Example use case:** A healthcare organization predicts patient readmission rates using SEMMA. They sample data from hospital records, explore patient histories for trends, modify features like patient age and diagnoses, build machine learning models, and assess their accuracy to choose the most effective predictor.

### Team Data Science Process (TDSP)

TDSP offers a collaborative and agile framework that organizes the lifecycle into four key stages: Business Understanding, Data Acquisition, Modeling, and Deployment. 

Designed with team-based workflows in mind, TDSP emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, ensuring that projects align with business needs while remaining flexible to changes. It’s well-suited for scenarios requiring close collaboration among data scientists, engineers, and stakeholders.

**Example use case:** A logistics company improves delivery route optimization. Using TDSP, the team collaborates to understand business goals, acquires data from GPS and traffic systems, develops routing models, and deploys them to dynamically suggest the fastest delivery routes.

### MLOps Lifecycle

MLOps focuses specifically on machine learning operations and production environments. Its stages include Data Engineering, Model Development, Model Deployment, and Monitoring. 

This lifecycle is essential for projects involving large-scale machine learning systems that demand high scalability and automation. 

MLOps integrates seamlessly with continuous integration and delivery pipelines, ensuring that deployed models remain effective and relevant as new data is introduced.

Each of these frameworks has its own strengths and is suited to different types of data science operations.

**Example use case:** An e-commerce platform deploys a recommendation engine using MLOps. They engineer data pipelines from user activity logs, develop collaborative filtering models, deploy them on the website, and monitor their performance to retrain models when new user data is added.

## How to Choose the Right Data Science Lifecycle

![How to pick a data science lifecycle](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/how-to-pick-a-lifecycle-q9t3m.png)

Determining the most suitable data science lifecycle for your data science project requires a systematic approach. After all, not all lifecycles are best suited for all situations.

You can follow these steps to identify the framework that aligns best with your goals and resources:
