Now, let’s get into the meat. If I were in your shoes, the first step I'd take is to understand the differences and similarities between business analytics and data science.

## Data science vs. business analytics: What sets them apart?

The difference between data science and business analytics comes down to how you want to work with data.

When I was making this decision, I had to ask myself: Do I enjoy coding, working with algorithms, and solving mathematical problems? If so, data science was the better fit. Or do I prefer analyzing trends, making strategic decisions, and communicating insights? In that case, business analytics made more sense.

If you go the data science route, you'll take a highly technical approach that blends [computer science](https://roadmap.sh/computer-science), mathematics, and business knowledge. You'll work with business analysts to understand key challenges, then clean, explore, and mine unstructured and structured data to improve its quality.

Once the data is ready, you'll build and test predictive models using machine learning algorithms to uncover hidden patterns. These models help businesses make data-driven predictions, optimize processes, and automate decision-making.

When I looked at these responsibilities, I realized data science was all about solving complex problems, discovering trends, and forecasting what's next. If that excites you, it might be the right path.

![Data science vs business analytics: what sets them apart?](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/data-science-vs-business-analytics-what-sets-them-apart-ineqp.png)

Business analytics might be a better fit if you don't fancy data science. You'll sit at the intersection of business, data, and operations. You are responsible for evaluating the business's overall health, identifying gaps, and recommending solutions to improve business operations.

You'll also perform basic data cleaning and transformation using tools like [SQL](https://roadmap.sh/sql) and Excel. However, your primary focus is analyzing data to uncover insights, create reports, and present findings to stakeholders.

Beyond analysis, I realized that business analysts also take action. You'll recommend strategic next steps based on data insights and collaborate with decision-makers to execute them. This means being involved in change strategy and ensuring that insights lead to tangible business improvements.

For example, imagine you work for an energy company and notice a drop in residential electricity usage due to increased solar panel adoption. A data scientist will build predictive models to forecast energy demand, optimize distribution, and detect anomalies. A business analyst, meanwhile, will interpret these insights, develop strategies like solar buyback programs, and lead their implementation to drive impact.

## What Are Their Similarities?

Although data science and business analytics have differences, after working in both fields, I realized that they share the same goal. Both disciplines focus on transforming raw data into valuable insights that drive business decisions.

![Data science vs business analytics: what connects them?](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/data-science-vs-business-analytics-what-connects-them-z10j8.png)

Think of them as two sides of the same coin. Both fields involve data mining, statistical analysis, data visualization, [SQL](https://roadmap.sh/sql) usage, problem-solving, and stakeholder collaboration. They work together to help businesses make sense of their data, but their approach and execution set them apart.

The next step to take is to understand what daily tasks may look like and which one you’d prefer.

## What Would Your Day-to-Day Look Like?

Your day-to-day life as a data scientist or business analyst depends on the size of your company and team, industry, and project focus. I’ll break down the primary responsibilities of both fields to give you a clearer picture.

What are the key responsibilities of a data scientist?
A data scientist analyzes complex data to extract insights, build predictive models, and support data-driven decision-making.

**Primary tasks:**

- **Business understanding**: Understand the why behind what you're building. You'll often work with stakeholders to define project and business requirements that guide data usage and model development.
- **Data ingestion**: Gather raw data from systems. This data is obtained from databases, APIs, IoT sensors, Excel sheets, etc. A data scientist collects all the relevant data needed to solve the current business problem.
- **Data processing, migration, and storage**: You'll spend most of your time cleaning, transforming, and migrating structured and unstructured raw data. The goal is to convert data into suitable formats and structures for analysis and accessibility.
- **Data analysis**: Data scientists identify patterns in data behavior using visualization tools and statistical techniques such as Bayesian Inference, A/B testing, and K-means clustering.
- **Building machine learning models**: You'll define the appropriate modeling approach based on business objectives, data characteristics, and analytical requirements. Then, you'll build, train, validate, and fine-tune the model using historical data to predict future trends or automate workflows. Depending on the use case, you may also leverage pre-trained models or transfer learning for faster deployment.
- **Deploying and testing predictive models**: You'll test your model against business requirements and deploy it to production.
- **Reporting**: You also need to present model results to stakeholders using visualizations and clear, concise explanations.

Data scientists collaborate closely with data engineers to build data extraction and transformation pipelines. You'll also work with business analysts and other stakeholders to set business requirements and align the model with them.

You'd perform these responsibilities using tools like TensorFlow, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, Scikit-learn, Apache Spark, Hadoop, [Docker](https://roadmap.sh/docker), [GitHub/Git](https://roadmap.sh/git-github), SQL, Tableau, and cloud platforms ([AWS],(https://roadmap.sh/aws) Google Cloud, Azure)

### What Are the Key Responsibilities of a Business Analyst?

As a business analyst, you'll bridge the gap between business needs and technical solutions by analyzing data and processes and using these insights to drive strategic decisions. Your primary tasks involve:

- **Data manipulation and analysis**: While business analysts don't need to be expert programmers, you need SQL and Excel for querying databases and lightly analyzing unstructured and structured data. Some business analysts also pick up Python for deeper analysis.
- **Business acumen**: You'd need to know how to perform holistic business analysis. This involves asking the right questions: How can I solve business problems with data? What processes benefit from data-driven insights? Do I have the right data? How can I start collecting this data? Understanding how different departments (marketing, sales, finance) operate is necessary to align data insights with business goals.
- **Data visualization and reporting**: You'll create interactive dashboards and reports using visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Google Data Studio.
- **Communication and stakeholder management**: You'll be involved in clearly communicating complex data insights and providing simple and actionable business recommendations. You'll often present findings to executives who may have little or no technical skills.

As a business analyst, you'll perform these responsibilities using Tableau, Power BI, Salesforce, Excel, Google Analytics, [SQL](https://roadmap.sh/sql), Microsoft Power BI, Google Sheets, and Looker.
