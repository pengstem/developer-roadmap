## What is data science and data engineering?

When I worked on my first data-driven project, I realized how much I enjoyed working with raw data. But I also saw how much effort went into setting up pipelines and structuring data before I could analyze it. That’s when I understood the fundamental difference: Data engineers build the highways, while data scientists drive on them to find insights.

Data science is a field that combines mathematics, statistics, analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to analyze large amounts of data to detect hidden patterns, generate actionable insights, and predict trends. As a data scientist, you’ll analyze and interpret complex data to help organizations and businesses make informed decisions.

On the other hand, data engineering involves designing and building systems for aggregating, storing, and analyzing data. As a data engineer, you’ll build data warehouses to empower data-driven decisions. You will focus on developing pipelines to collect, clean, and transform data, ensuring it is accessible for analysis by the data science team.

## Key responsibilities of a data scientist

Your responsibilities as a data scientist will vary depending on the industry, company size, and project focus. To provide more context, I will explain the responsibilities of a data scientist using a project I worked on during my career. The project involved customer churn analysis for a client in the hospitality industry.


![Data Scientist Responsibilities](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/data-scientist-skills-and-tools-wi5tz.png)


1. **Business understanding:** As a data scientist, you’ll work closely with stakeholders to understand the context and gain business insights. 
  In the customer churn analysis project, I worked closely with the client to understand the business context and gain insights. This provided an in-depth understanding of the hospitality sector and the different terms used. Without this, solving the business problem would have been almost impossible.

2. **Data ingestion:** Your work as a data scientist involves gathering raw data from different sources. It is your responsibility as a data scientist to collect all the relevant data to solve the current business problem.
  
  When I worked on the customer churn analysis project, I had to pull data from multiple sources (customer transaction logs, website analytics, and CRM tools). But before I could even begin the analysis, the data engineers had to build ETL pipelines to collect and clean this data.
    
3. **Data processing and data storage:** This is one of your core responsibilities as a data scientist. It involves cleaning and transforming the ingested data into suitable formats for analysis and saving data storage systems.

  In the customer churn analysis project, the data ingested were unusable and had to be cleaned so they could be used for analysis. I used tools like Python and NumPy to process the data and saved the processed data in a database.
    
4. **Data analysis:** As a data scientist, you’ll analyze processed data using statistical analysis and data visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas. You’ll explore the data to understand relationships, hidden patterns, characteristics, and anomalies. You will use charts and graphs to make the data more understandable and easier to comprehend.

    In the customer churning analysis project, I analyzed the data by identifying the number of returning customers, the customers who came only once, the day of the week with the most customers, and so on. With this analysis, I could identify a trend in the data, which helped in predictive model building.

5. **Model building:** As a data scientist, you’ll build predictive models and machine learning algorithms to forecast future trends. The machine learning algorithms you build can be categorized into two types: 
    - Supervised learning: Examples include linear regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors.
    - Unsupervised learning: Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

 6. **Reporting:** As a data scientist, it is your responsibility to interpret and communicate the results of data analysis and predictions. It is not enough to analyze and explore the data; you have to communicate them clearly so that the key stakeholders easily understand them, influence decision-making, and achieve business goals.

## Skills and tools needed to succeed as a data scientist

To succeed as a data scientist, you need to have a balance of technical and analytical skills. Some of these skills and tools I recommend include:

![Data Scientist Skills and Tools](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/data-scientist-skills-and-tools-7fjnk.png)


1. **Programming languages:** As a data scientist, you should know some programming. The two most common programming languages data scientists use are [Python](https://roadmap.sh/python) and R.

2. **Mathematics and statistics:** To succeed as a data scientist, you must know mathematics and statistics. They help you understand your data and know which statistical model to apply. Knowledge of mathematical concepts like calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra are fundamental to your success as a data scientist.

4. **Database management systems:** Database management systems are applications that interact with users, other applications, and the database to fetch and analyze data. As a data scientist, you will interact a lot with databases, and you should know how to write queries to communicate with them. 

  [SQL](https://roadmap.sh/sql) is a programming language used to manage and communicate with relational databases. Examples of relational databases are MySQL, [PostgreSQL](https://roadmap.sh/postgresql-dba), and Microsoft Server SQL. There are also NoSQL databases that store unstructured data. Examples include [MongoDB](https://roadmap.sh/mongodb), Neo4j, and Cassandra.

5. **Machine learning and artificial intelligence:** As a data scientist, you should have an understanding of machine learning. Machine learning can be divided into supervised, unsupervised, deep, and reinforced learning. Some key tools used by data scientists include Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

## Key responsibilities of a data engineer

To explain the key responsibilities of a data engineer, I will use an IoT project I worked on to provide more context. The project involved developing an IoT data pipeline to transmit data from a customer’s IoT devices in the field to a storage system. Your key responsibilities as a data engineer include:

![Data Engineer Responsibilities](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/data-engineer-job-description-i0k7i.png)

1. **Data pipeline development:** A data pipeline is a method of ingesting data from different data sources, transforming the data, and then transferring it to storage and processing systems. You are responsible for building and maintaining data pipelines as a data engineer. The different types of data pipelines include:
    - Batch processing pipelines 
    - Data streaming pipelines
    - Data integration pipelines
    - Cloud-native data pipelines
    In the IoT project, the data engineers designed the data pipeline used to transmit data from the IoT devices to the data storage system. The pipeline was a messaging system into which the IoT devices published data, which was ingested and stored in a database.

2. **Data architecture design:** As a data engineer, you will build, design, and manage data lakes and warehouses for data storage and retrieval. You will work with cloud platforms ([AWS](https://roadmap.sh/aws), GCP, Azure) to develop scalable and reliable storage solutions.

3. **Database management:** As a data engineer, you’ll manage and optimize storage solutions, which include relational databases, document databases, and data lakes. These data storage solutions store big data for analysis and prediction for data integrity, performance, and accessibility. 

4. **ETL processes development:** Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) is a process that cleans and organizes data from multiple data sources into a single and consistent data set for storage and further processing. As a data engineer, you are responsible for developing and maintaining the ETL process for proper data integration and onward passage of the data to be used by data scientists.

    The data from the IoT devices was in different formats, so the data engineers had to build an ETL process to transform the data for onward processing and storage.

5. **Real-time data streaming:** Data engineers process real-time data from different data sources, which can be triggered via events or observers. As a data engineer, you design systems that respond to real-time data, and use tools like Google Publish and Subscribe and Azure Publish and Subscribe to transmit and process it.

    The data sent from the IoT devices was real-time data, and the data engineers built the messaging system that streamed the data. 

6. **Data governance and security:** Data engineers are responsible for compliance with data privacy laws. They implement data validation and integrity checks, which results in clean data and data reliability. They also make sure that sensitive user data is protected and not exposed without sufficient clearance.

## Skills and tools needed to succeed as a data engineer

To succeed as a data engineer, you need a combination of programming, data management, data pipelines, and cloud computing skills. I will explain the skills below.
