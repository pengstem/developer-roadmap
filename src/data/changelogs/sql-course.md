After months of work, I am excited to announce our [brand-new SQL course](/courses/sql) designed to help you master SQL with a hands-on, practical approach!

For the past few months, we have been working on building a course platform that would not only help us deliver high-quality educational content but also sustain the development of roadmap.sh. This SQL course is our first step in that direction.

The course has been designed with a focus on practical learning. Each topic is accompanied by hands-on exercises, real-world examples, and an integrated coding environment where you can practice what you learn. The AI integration provides personalized learning assistance, helping you grasp concepts better and faster.

Check out the course at [roadmap.sh/courses/sql](https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql)
