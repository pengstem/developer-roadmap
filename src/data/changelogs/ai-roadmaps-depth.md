We have improved our AI roadmaps, added a way to schedule learning time, and made some site wide bug fixes and improvements. Here are the details:

- [AI generated roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/ai) are now 3 levels deep giving you more detailed information. We have also improved the quality of the generated roadmaps.
- Schedule learning time on your calendar for any roadmap. Just click on the "Schedule Learning Time" button and select the time slot you want to block.
- You can now dismiss the sticky roadmap progress indicator at the bottom of any roadmap. 
- We have added some new Project Ideas to our [Frontend Roadmap](/frontend/projects).
- Bug fixes and performance improvements

We have a new Engineering Manager Roadmap coming this week. Stay tuned!
