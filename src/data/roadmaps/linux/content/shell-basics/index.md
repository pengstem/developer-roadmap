# Linux Shell Basics

The Linux shell is a command-line interface or terminal used to interact directly with the operating system. The shell helps facilitate system commands and acts as an intermediary interface between the user and the system's kernel. The shell can perform complex tasks efficiently and quickly. There are many types of shells available in Linux, including the Bourne Shell (sh), the C Shell (csh), and the Bourne-Again Shell (bash).

The basics of using a Linux shell include navigating between directories, creating, renaming and deleting files and directories, and executing system commands. This introductory level knowledge is crucial for Linux system administration, scripting, and automation.

This is a follow up exercise to make your first bash script. Please run the commands in the terminal one by one and try to understand what they do:
```
touch my_first_script.sh
chmod +x my_first_script.sh
echo "date" > my_first_script.sh
./my_first_script.sh
```
