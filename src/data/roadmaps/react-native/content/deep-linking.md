# Deep Linking

Deep linking is a technique used in mobile applications that allows you to open a specific screen, content, or functionality within the application using a URL or a custom URL scheme. This is useful for providing seamless user experiences by navigating the user directly to the desired part of the app. Deep linking can be triggered by clicking on a link in an email, scanning a QR code, or through a push notification.

There are two types of deep links:

1. **Universal Links** (iOS) / **App Links** (Android): These are HTTPS URLs that allow the user to navigate to a specific screen when the app is installed and fallback to a specified website when the app is not installed.
2. **Custom URL Schemes**: Unique URLs, like `myapp://my-screen`, that can open the app directly to a specific screen when clicked.
