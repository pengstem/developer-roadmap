# Listings

When working with listings in React Native, commonly used components include **FlatList**, **SectionList**, and **VirtualizedList**. **FlatList** is a high-performance, scrollable list component that efficiently renders a large number of items. It is ideal for displaying simple lists of data. **SectionList** is similar but is used for displaying data in separate sections with headers, making it suitable for grouped data presentations.

**VirtualizedList** is a lower-level component that provides more fine-grained control over list rendering performance, making it useful for complex lists or when custom behavior is needed. These components are essential for managing dynamic data and displaying large lists effectively in React Native applications.
